      <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
      
      <div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>By purchasing ClientOS, you agree to the following terms and conditions. Please read carefully before proceeding with your order.</strong></p>
      </div>
      
      <h2>1. Project Overview</h2>
      <p>Dizzy Otter Ltd will design, build, and deliver the ClientOS system — a customised business operating system built in Notion and supported by automation and AI tools — to streamline the Client's operations and workflows.</p>
      
      <h2>2. Scope of Work</h2>
      <p>The ClientOS package includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A custom Notion Business HQ dashboard</li>
        <li>A personalised GPT assistant trained on the Client's data</li>
        <li>A smart lead system connecting Tally or Fillout forms to Notion</li>
        <li>Automated email outreach (e.g., review requests after onboarding)</li>
        <li>A Loom video library explaining all key processes</li>
        <li>One live 60-minute training session (recorded for future use)</li>
        <li>30 days of ongoing support after delivery</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Additional or custom features not listed above will be treated as separate work and quoted accordingly.</p>
      
      <h2>3. Fees & Payment</h2>
      <p><strong>Total Fee:</strong> £699 (one-off, payable in full before work begins)</p>
      <p><strong>Support Renewal:</strong> After 30 days, optional ongoing support and optimisation is available at £79/month.</p>
      <p>Payment is made via Stripe, bank transfer, or other approved method. Work will begin once payment has cleared.</p>
      
      <h2>4. Delivery & Timeline</h2>
      <p>Dizzy Otter will begin work within two (2) business days of payment and deliver the completed system within 7 days, unless otherwise agreed in writing.</p>
      <p>The Provider will supply the system, training session, and Loom videos by the agreed delivery date.</p>
      
      <h2>5. Revisions</h2>
      <p>One round of reasonable revisions is included to ensure the system aligns with the Client's needs.</p>
      <p>Further changes, additions, or re-structuring beyond that will be billed at £75/hour.</p>
      
      <h2>6. Tools & Ownership</h2>
      <p>Dizzy Otter will build ClientOS using third-party platforms (including Notion, Tally, OpenAI ChatGPT, and n8n).</p>
      <p>The Client owns all assets, templates, databases, and automations created specifically for their business.</p>
      <p>Any third-party subscriptions (e.g., Notion Plus, Tally Pro, ChatGPT Plus, n8n hosting) are not included in the £699 setup fee and remain the Client's responsibility.</p>
      <p>The Client may choose:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Self-Hosted:</strong> all systems transferred to the Client's own accounts; or</li>
        <li><strong>Managed Hosting:</strong> Dizzy Otter hosts and maintains systems on its accounts for an additional monthly fee (to be agreed if selected).</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>7. Support</h2>
      <p>Dizzy Otter will provide email and chat support for 30 days following delivery.</p>
      <p>After that, continued support and updates are optional via the £79/month plan.</p>
      <p>Support covers troubleshooting, small updates, and guidance. Major rebuilds or feature additions are quoted separately.</p>
      
      <h2>8. Refunds & Cancellations</h2>
      <p>Refunds are available before work begins or if Dizzy Otter fails to deliver the agreed system within 14 days of the scheduled completion date.</p>
      <p>Once the build has started, the project becomes non-refundable due to the time and customisation involved.</p>
      <p>If the Client cancels midway, all work completed to date remains the property of Dizzy Otter until full payment is received.</p>
      
      <h2>9. Confidentiality</h2>
      <p>Both parties agree to keep all confidential information, business data, and materials shared during this project private and not disclose them to third parties.</p>
      
      <h2>10. Liability</h2>
      <p>Dizzy Otter Ltd provides all deliverables in good faith and with professional care but cannot guarantee specific business outcomes or results.</p>
      <p>Liability is limited to the total amount paid under this agreement.</p>
      
      <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>This agreement is governed by and construed under the laws of England and Wales.</p>
      <p>Any disputes will be handled through UK courts.</p>
      
      <h2>12. Acceptance</h2>
      <p>By paying the invoice, the Client agrees to the terms of this agreement and authorises Dizzy Otter Ltd to begin work.</p>
