      <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
      
      <div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>(Last updated: October 2025)</strong></p>
      </div>
      
      <h2>1. Overview</h2>
      <p>Dizzy Otter Ltd ("the Provider") offers consultancy and implementation services that help clients identify, design, and deploy AI-powered automations and workflow systems ("the Services").</p>
      <p>All engagements begin with a free AI Audit, after which a written proposal and quote are supplied.</p>
      
      <h2>2. Scope of Work</h2>
      <p>The scope for each project will be detailed in the written proposal agreed by both parties.</p>
      <p>Typical deliverables may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Automation design and implementation using tools such as Notion, n8n, Tally, and OpenAI ChatGPT.</li>
        <li>Custom dashboards or GPT assistants.</li>
        <li>Training or documentation to enable continued use.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Any work outside the agreed scope will be quoted separately.</p>
      
      <h2>3. Fees & Payment</h2>
      <p><strong>The AI Audit is free of charge.</strong></p>
      <p>Implementation projects are quoted individually (typical ranges £300 – £1,500).</p>
      <p>Optional ongoing support or optimisation is available on a monthly retainer (typically £300 – £500 / month).</p>
      <p>Payment terms and schedule will be confirmed in the written proposal. Work begins once the initial invoice is paid.</p>
      <p>All prices are exclusive of any third-party subscription costs (e.g., Notion Plus, ChatGPT Plus, n8n hosting).</p>
      
      <h2>4. Delivery & Timeline</h2>
      <p>Timelines are agreed per project. Dizzy Otter will act in good faith to deliver on schedule but is not responsible for delays caused by dependencies outside its control (e.g., client feedback, third-party outages).</p>
      
      <h2>5. Revisions</h2>
      <p>Unless otherwise stated, one round of reasonable revisions is included. Additional changes or new feature requests will be billed at the hourly rate specified in the proposal.</p>
      
      <h2>6. Tools & Ownership</h2>
      <p>Systems are built using third-party platforms under their respective terms.</p>
      <p>The client owns all custom automations, templates, and data created specifically for their business once full payment is received.</p>
      <p>Dizzy Otter retains the right to reuse non-confidential frameworks and generic code for future projects.</p>
      
      <h2>7. Support</h2>
      <p>Where included, post-delivery support covers minor fixes, advice, and updates. Major new work will be quoted separately. Retainer clients receive priority response and proactive optimisation.</p>
      
      <h2>8. Refunds & Cancellations</h2>
      <p>Because each project is bespoke:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The free audit carries no obligation.</li>
        <li>Once paid project work has begun, fees are non-refundable except where Dizzy Otter fails to deliver the agreed scope within a reasonable period.</li>
        <li>Either party may cancel before work begins with no penalty.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>9. Confidentiality</h2>
      <p>Both parties agree to keep all business information and data shared during the project strictly confidential.</p>
      
      <h2>10. Data Protection</h2>
      <p>Each party is responsible for compliance with applicable data-protection laws (including UK GDPR).</p>
      <p>Dizzy Otter acts as a data processor only for data handled within client-specific automations and uses compliant third-party services such as Supabase and Notion.</p>
      <p>Full details of processing and sub-processors are available on request.</p>
      
      <h2>11. Liability</h2>
      <p>Dizzy Otter Ltd provides services in good faith and with reasonable skill and care but cannot guarantee specific commercial outcomes.</p>
      <p>Liability is limited to the total amount paid for the relevant project.</p>
      
      <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>These terms are governed by and construed under the laws of England and Wales.</p>
      <p>Any disputes will be subject to the jurisdiction of the UK courts.</p>
      
      <h2>13. Acceptance</h2>
      <p>By accepting a proposal or paying an invoice, the client agrees to these terms and authorises Dizzy Otter Ltd to commence work.</p>
