To complete the efficiency cleanup:

1. Delete these files (no longer needed):
   - src/styles/fact-solution-box.css
   - src/pages/_trash/Blog.js
   - src/App.test.js

2. Refactor all useScrollReveal and useScrollToTop hooks to import from src/hooks/.

3. Remove commented-out code and unused imports in all JS files.

4. Move shared CSS rules (e.g. .scroll-down-arrow, .hero-title) to global.css.

5. Reduce !important usage where possible.

6. Remove legacy/empty CSS rules.

7. Consolidate color/spacing variables and optimize media queries.

This will keep the site efficient, maintainable, and fast for production.
